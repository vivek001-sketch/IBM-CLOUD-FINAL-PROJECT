## 🚀 Project Overview

In industrial systems, detecting and classifying faults early is crucial to minimize downtime, reduce maintenance costs, and improve safety. This machine learning-based solution leverages IBM Cloud capabilities to:

- Preprocess and clean the dataset
- Train machine learning models for fault detection and classification
- Deploy the model using IBM Watson Machine Learning
- Provide a simple interface for predictions

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

- **Problem Type**: Multiclass Classification
- **ML Algorithm**: Logistic Regression / Random Forest / AutoML (depending on dataset and selection)
- **Dataset**: Fault data with features like temperature, pressure, vibration, current, voltage, etc.
- **Target**: Fault Type (e.g., Normal, Mechanical Failure, Electrical Fault, Sensor Error)

## 🛠️ IBM Cloud Services Used

- **IBM Cloud Object Storage** – For storing dataset
- **IBM Watson Studio** – For building and training the model
- **IBM AutoAI / Jupyter Notebook** – For model experimentation
- **IBM Watson Machine Learning** – For model deployment
